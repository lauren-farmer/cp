CP and ILP via Graph Burning

We will be working through some advanced work on CP and ILP modelling using the graph burning problem as a central theme.  We will look at several papers on the topic, and compare different approaches looking at the development over time.  

Here are links to the papers that we will be looking at:

A survey on graph burning in general: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10642
