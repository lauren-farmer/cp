For this practice task, we used the following marking scheme:

A1: correctly solved all of the instances
B1: correctly solved most of the instances
C1: correctly solved some but not most of the instances
D1: correctly solved a few of the instances
E1: correctly solved one or part of one of the instances
F1: submitted, but solved none of the instances


(If your code is misnamed or does not run for some other reason, you will have received an F1, but also a comment on how you would have done if it had been correctly named.  Remember this does not count for your final mark.)
