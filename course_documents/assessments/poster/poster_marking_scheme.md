# CP 2024 Poster Marking Scheme - DRAFT

This assessment is band marked, which means you won't get a numerical mark, but instead a band - similar to a dissertation.  When marking, we will consider the following:


## Poster submission - total 40% of grade: 
- Content (weighted 80%): 
    - Introduction and relationship to wider field
        - Is the choice of paper motivated, is the problem considered well-introduced and clear? 
        - Is it clear that the student understands the approaches used?
    	- Does the poster give context and show understanding of the field?
	- Is the importance of the paper clear?  Is it clear how this paper relates to others?
    - Results discussion
    	- Does the student clearly understand the results and their implications?
    - Discussion of limitations
    	- Are the limitations of the paper, both in the work itself and in the context of the field clear?
      	- Is it clear that the student has reflected critically on the contribution of the paper?
    - Concluding thoughts
    	- Has the student summarised the most important aspects of the paper?
      	- Is it clear that the student understands why these are important, and has made suitable choices on what to emphasise?
