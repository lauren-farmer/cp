# Welcome and Intro to Constraint Programming

## The Plan
### Topics
There is some possible wiggle here, but the current plan is:
- Combinatorial optimisation and decision problems
- Intro to CP and CSP
- Modelling problems as CP in MiniZinc
- Global and special constraints
- Arc consistency and search approaches for CP
- Other solvers for combinatorial problems
- Combinatorial search for games
- Cool CP stuff from researchers

### Assessment
This course is coursework-only.  There is thus a lot of coursework, so you will need to manage things fairly carefully.  I want to emphasise this again: there is a lot of coursework, and some is demanding.  

We are planning:

Quizzes (20%):
- Five Multiple choice Moodle quizzes
    - Total 20%, spread throughout semester
    - Automatically marked.  We will use 4 of 5 to calculate your grade.
 
Assignments (30%):
- *Formative* Assignment 0: MiniZinc modelling startup task  *Formative*
    - Relatively simple problem (dominating set), focus on a correct model
    - 0% of grade, due Monday 6th October
    - Aims: to give the students low-stakes practice in running models, dealing with auto-marking submissions, running on stlinux
- Assignment 1: MiniZinc modelling assignment
    - MiniZinc model of dominating set with variable domination distances - focus on correctness
    - 5% of grade, due Monday 13 October.  Submit on Moodle
    - Code will be automarked on an stlinux node
- Assignment 2: ILP modelling assignment
    - ILP model of dominating set with variable domination distances - focus on correctness
    - 5% of grade, due Monday 20 October.  Submit on Moodle
    - Code will be automarked on an stlinux node
- Assignment 3a: MiniZinc and ILP models (code)
    - MiniZinc and ILP models of the Graph Burning Problem, both correctness and efficiency assessed
    - 10% of grade, due Monday November 24. Submit on Moodle
    - Code will be automarked on an stlinux node
- Assignment 3b: Viva
    - Live approximately 10-minute viva with questions on assignment 3 code and associate graph burning content from papers discussed in lecture       - 10% of grade, held November 25 and 26, band marked
Poster (50%):
- *Formative* Poster registration checkpoint:
    - Register the paper that you plan to present your poster on via Moodle
    - 0% of grade, due Friday October 31st
    - Aims: to get students thinking about the poster in good time, to allow lecturer to read papers and be able to give feedback
- Poster submission:
    - A research-style poster based on an existing CP/ILP/Combinatorial game search paper
    - 40% of grade, due Friday Nov 14th, band marked
    - A2 in size, PDF format.  Submit on Moodle
- Poster day with live poster question:
    - December 3rd, live in-person
    - Lecturer asks student one or two questions over approximately 5 minutes about the technical content of their poster
    - 10% of grade, band marked


All assessment submissions are due by 4:30 pm on the day they are due.  Some will be automatically marked, some band-marked.  

### Weekly Sessions

Teaching is on Wednesdays from 9-11 and 13-14.  I'm planning to use the morning session for material, and the afternoon for Q&A, working on problems, etc - but there will 

If the room has the infrastructure I'll record, but I cannot promise this will always work.  In particular my experience is that recordings of handwriten board or visualiser material can be mediocre - feel free to take photos of anything you think is useful in lecture.  


## Expectations
### Of me
- be a reasonable human being
- be as transparent and clear as possible with material and assessment methods
- be as prepared as I can
    - but please be generous - I try to run the course reasonably interactively
- respond to contact within two weekdays unless I am away/sick/etc
    - sometimes this might be to ask you to save the question for a Wednesday session
- give feedback within the School's standard timeframe

### Of you
- be a reasonable human being
- engage with the material regularly
- attend sessions when you can 
    - please don't attend if you are infectiously unwell
- try to bring questions to our Wednesday sessions
- manage your time over the semester
