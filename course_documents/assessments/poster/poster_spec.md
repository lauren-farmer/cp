# CP Assessment: Research Poster

*You may complete the poster portion of this assessment individually or in pairs.  The description that follows is for the individual option - the paired option differences are in a section at the end.*

For this assessment, you will make an A2 research poster about a published paper within the area of constraint programming or combinatorial game search.  You may choose a paper of interest to you - if you are concerned that it is not sufficiently CP-focussed, or is unsuitable for some other reason you should check the paper with CP's lecturer (Jess Enright in 2024).  In case you are unable to find a paper, there is a list to get you started at the end of this document.  A marking scheme will also be made available.  

### What should be on your poster

Your poster should be A2 in size, and should include a title, an introduction to the topic of the paper, a section describing the results, a section describing how you think the paper fits into the wider field of CP/optimisation or other computing topics (you might want to comment on the importance of an application, or the importance of a technique), a section describing the limitations of the paper or any criticism you have of it, and a short conclusion.  

### How to submit your poster
Please submit your poster on Moodle as a PDF file.  Ensure it is A2 size.  You should print your poster for poster-day - you can either print it as a research poster in one piece, or you can print A4 sheets and tape them together - either is fine.  If you want a one-piece research poster and cost is a barrier, contact the lecturer - she can print a small number of these posters.  


### Poster day
We will display printed posters on a Wednesday and hold a live poster day.   Given the size of the class, we will likely rotate posters over the day.  When your poster is up,  the lecturer will come around and ask a question about your poster - this will be part of your mark.

There are many more out there - following citations from these will help you find them.  We can suggest looking at this past year's CP conference (https://cp2025.a4cp.org/accepted_papers.html).

###  Forbidden papers:
These are papers that we have seen too many previous posters on.  You are not allowed to do a poster on:
- https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16657/
- https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15396-9_37

You should also avoid papers focussing on LLMs in CP - these tend to lack the technical alignment with the course objectives you need to get a good grade. 

You will register your paper choice for poster near the end of October, submit a PDF of your poster in mid-November, and attend poster day in the last week of classes.  All dates on Moodle.  


### Pair poster option  
You may optionally work in a pair to complete the poster portion of this assessment.  The live question/presentation mark will still be conducted individually.  If you work in a pair, you and your partner must each chose a paper and these two papers should be closely related.  They might be competing techniques, or one an improvement of another, or different approaches to the same problem, etc.  You will then produce one **A1** size poster, with clear sections introducing the topic, describing the main contribution of each of the two papers, and an extra section highlighting how the two papers are related.
