# Hard Instances

Reminder: what does it mean for a problem to be NP-hard?

- First: it *doesn't* mean that every instance of that problem is hard to solve.  
- (Informally) it means that we can take any instance of any other problem in NP and encode it as an instance of our problem.

Let's talk about graph colouring:
- 3-colouring is NP-complete
    - (graph colouring is NP-hard)
- We can take any instance of any problem in NP and make it into a 3-colouring instance such that the yes/no answer stays the same.  

But, as we've touched on briefly, this doesn't mean that every instance is hard!

There are some important ideas here, including the notions of being 
- underconstrained
- overconstrained

What do these notions look like in a search tree?

## Phase transitions in various problems
    
If we have an idea of a characteristic of instances that move them from under to over constrained, we might plot runtime of our solver as a function of that parameter.  We sometimes see what is called a *phase transition* when we do this.  
    
We'll look at some examples as we go along.  
    
Side note: the phrase *phase transition* is from chemistry/physics - as in the transition from liquid to solid.
